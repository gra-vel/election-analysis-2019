# Ecuador election analysis 2019
 
This project is an exploratory analysis of the mayoral elections in Ecuador that took place in 2009. Data comes from an open source database that belongs to the [National Electoral Council of Ecuador](http://cne.gob.ec/es/estadisticas/bases-de-datos/category/1580-elecciones-seccionales-2019). This is my first project using R. The project does not focuses on the political analysis, but on the use of differente packages for data wrangling and visualization. 

There are two data files for political parties and election results. For visualization, I used plotly and ggplot2. In the R script, the code for ggplot2 is commented out. There is a jupyter notebook with the visualization for ggplot2. In branch gh-pages, there is an Rmarkdown for the visualization with plotly. This available in the [url of the project](https://gra-vel.github.io/election-analysis-2019/).
